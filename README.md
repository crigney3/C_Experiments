## Experiments in C

-----

Over the period of this year, I hope to use this repo to teach myself **C/C++** (mostly **C**) and use it to challenge myself and grow my skillset!

*Side not as I'm just noticing it now: Visual Studio builds my files into .cpp files, which is way the repo claims to be C++. At the point of writing this (Project 3), all my code is in C.*

1. Hello, World!
    1. Purpose:
        1. Play around with the basic concepts of C.
    2. New Skills:
        1. Variables, Conditionals, Loops, and Arrays
        2. #define, #include
        3. sizeof();
1. Structs, Pointers, and Collision
    1. Purpose:
        1. Teach myself structs (relating them to objects in OOP)
        2. Learn the basics of pointer access and dereferencing
        3. Do basic collision detection between rectangle structs
    2. New Skils:
        1. printf % arguments
        2. void functions using pointers to modify global variables
        3. printing pointers, accessing variable values from only pointers
1. Memory allocation, circle collision, and freeing
    1. Purpose:
        1. Learn manual memory allocation to make future programs maximally efficient
        2. Create a generic circle collider that frees all unnecessary variables once done checking
    2. New Skils:
        1. malloc, more pointer skills, free
        2. Circle collision
